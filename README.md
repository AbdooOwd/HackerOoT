# Abdoo-OoT

`abdoo-oot` is a romhack I am developing using [HackerOoT](https://github.com/HackerN64/HackerOoT).

## Tools

There are a few tools I developed for this project. They're all stored 
in [`tools/abdoo`](./tools/abdoo/).

For now, you can find a few Python "helper" scripts:
-   `object_adder`: Adds your new object to the `spec` and object table.
-   `scene_adder`: Adds your new scene to the Map Select, `spec`, and adds
    a default entrance to the entrance table (iirc).
